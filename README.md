# Alpha-Blog-API

AlphaBlog is centered around a powerful API-driven architecture. Instead of relying on traditional MVC views, I've crafted a robust API using Rails. The core revolves around a Post model, managed by a dedicated PostsController that provides API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts. This API-first approach allows for a clean separation between the backend logic and any potential frontends that may interact with AlphaBlog in the future

AlphaBlog's backend also features administrator empowerment through API endpoints. Admins can efficiently manage posts by leveraging the power of user roles, authentication, and authorization. The API provides endpoints for admins to edit or delete any post, maintaining a secure and controlled environment. This showcases the flexibility of RoR in handling backend logic for different user roles
